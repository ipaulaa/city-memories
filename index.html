        <h1><span>A Life in Motion:</span> Growing Up on the Move</h1>
        <p>
          Throughout my childhood, my family’s frequent relocations shaped my
          experiences and worldview in profound ways. Due to my father’s career,
          we moved from city to city, often packing our lives into boxes and
          embracing new beginnings. Each place we called home left its mark,
          from the landscapes and cultures to the friendships and memories I
          carry with me. This transient lifestyle taught me adaptability,
          resilience, and a deep appreciation for the diverse stories that
          different cities hold.
